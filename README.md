🐶 Dog Breed Classification with Deep Learning

This project explores the challenge of automatically classifying dog breeds using state-of-the-art deep learning and supervised learning techniques.

We worked with a dataset containing images of multiple breeds, splitting them into training/validation and test sets. Models were trained and evaluated not only on the original images but also on dog regions automatically detected with YOLO 🛰️, improving focus on the relevant features.

The core architecture is a ResNet convolutional neural network 🧠, chosen for its strong performance in image classification tasks. This project demonstrates how modern computer vision techniques can tackle the complexity of distinguishing visually similar dog breeds.
